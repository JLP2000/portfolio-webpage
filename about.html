          I am a MEng Electrical and Electronics graduate that has recently
          completed a bootcamp with

          During my time at university and on the bootcamp, I've gained the
          experience of working in multiple group projects and some solo ones
          and I am currently looking for work within the tech industry where I
          can utilize my skills and continue to learn and develop within a
          professional setting.

          I first discovered coding during my time at University, the first
          language I ever learnt was Java in my first-year. I fell in love with
          the concept of programming instantly and wanted to learn more!
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continued through my course, I continued to learn different
          coding languages and the working behind the languages such as C, 8051
          Assembly language, Arduino. I really enjoyed learning these new
          languages and started to develop a passion for it
        </p>
        <p>
          During my third year and final year project is when I decided I really
          wanted to pursue a career on the software side of tech. I noticed that
          the parts of the course that I found most interesting and enjoyable
          for myself was whenever I got to learn code or build and develop
          programs for my hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, as I started to look more into the tech industry and the skills
          required, I had realized that the languages that I had been taught
          were only the beginning and I needed to learn more. The programming
          languages and skills that I had learnt during my time at University
          were low-level languages. I needed to find a way where I could learn
          and build a strong foundation of skills that would allow me to enter
          the tech industry which is where I stumbled onto La Fosse Academy.

      <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 25%; padding-right: 25%">
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: left">How?</h1>
        <p>
          After I graduated university, I started to self-learn Python through
          Youtube tutorials and w3schools, but soon hit a wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realised I didn't know what skills employers were actually looking
          for and what should I be learning? How should I structure my files?
          What is Github?
        </p>
        <p>
          I went on a 13-week tech bootcamp at La Fosse Academy in October 2022,
          where I learnt so many new skills and languages including HTML, CSS,
          Javascript, React, Redux, SQL, noSQL, and Python
        </p>
        <p>
          During the bootcamp, I got to work with many great devs, get some
          experience working agile using Trello and Kanban. It was an amazing
          experience where I got to meet and work with amazing people and gain
          more experience working in group projects which made me more
          determined to build more full stack projects
        </p>

      <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 50%; padding-right: 100px">
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: left">Now.</h1>
        <p>
          On completion of the bootcamp, I have learnt many languages and skills
          and I now am looking for work within the tech industry in order to
          continue to learn and develop my skills and put what I have learn to
          some good use!
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to be able to find a position that will allow me to continue to
          learn about the tech industry and new technologies and gain more
          experience to continue to strengthen what I have learnt
        </p>
        <p>
          I am constantly looking for new ways to level up my skill by
          completing mini-projects in my free-time to continue to learn more and
          keep myself sharp!
